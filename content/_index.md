I'm a political scientist working on democracy, delegation and the legitimacy of unelected bodies; political economy; and migration and border control. I work as a postdoctoral fellow at [ARENA Centre for European Studies](https://www.sv.uio.no/arena/english/people/aca/trymnf/index.html), University of Oslo.
