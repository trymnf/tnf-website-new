## An interview with Johan P. Olsen 

[This](https://www.sv.uio.no/arena/english/research/news-and-events/news/2017/olsen-democracy-2017.html) is an interview with Prof. Johan P. Olsen that I did together with Hanne Iglebæk Christensen in 2017. (Also published [in Norwegian](https://www.sv.uio.no/arena/forskning/aktuelt/aktuelle-saker/2017/johan-p-olsen-democracy.html).)
